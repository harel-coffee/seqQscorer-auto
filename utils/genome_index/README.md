In this folder you could have the genome index for bowtie. Of course you can use your own index if you have. 
Otherwise use the commands below to download and unzip the human and/or mouse genome index.

```
wget https://genome-idx.s3.amazonaws.com/bt/GRCh38_noalt_as.zip     # for downloading
unzip GRCh38_noalt_as.zip                                           # for unzipping

wget https://genome-idx.s3.amazonaws.com/bt/mm10.zip                # for downloading
unzip mm10.zip                                                      # for unzipping
